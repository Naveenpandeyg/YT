    <h1>Vedic period (1750–800 BCE)</h1>
    <h2>sometimes also termed Dharmic religions or Indic</h2>
    <p>The religions that originated in the Indian subcontinent. These religions, which include Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism,[web 1][note 1] are also classified as Eastern religions. Although Indian religions are connected through the history of India, they constitute a wide range of religious communities, and are not confined to the Indian subcontinent.[web 1]
      <br>Indian religions by number of followers (2020 survey)[1][2][3][4] Religion 	Population
      <br>Hindus (Om.svg) 	1.2 billion
      Buddhists (Dharma Wheel.svg) 	520 million
      Sikhs (Khanda.svg) 	30 million
      Jains (Jainism.svg) 	6 million
      Others 	4 million
      Total 	1.76 billion
      
      Evidence attesting to prehistoric religion in the Indian subcontinent derives from scattered Mesolithic rock paintings. The Harappan people of the Indus Valley civilisation, which lasted from 3300 to 1300 BCE (mature period 2600–1900 BCE), had an early urbanized culture which predates the Vedic religion.</p>

    <p>These cats will be the showrunners this year. George has a long history in cat events, and is looking forward to this year's Cat Fancy Event. Sam is a world-class runner, and will be showing his new techniques. Doug likes to lay around, and will practice his abilities. Sally was invited because her mom made a fit about not coming.</p>
